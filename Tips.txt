smb payload

Tips:-   Scan the entire subnet for open smb ports. You can use the wordlist available on the desktop on Parrot os. Use Hydra to crack it. You can also use Metasploit to crack the password. Use Msfconsole auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login . The password for the encoded file is the same. If the file contains a hash, try to decode it.
